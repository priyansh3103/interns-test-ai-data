## ðŸ”§ What I Have Done  

### 1. Built a Modular NLP Pipeline  
- Designed a pipeline using Python that combines rule-based techniques with semantic NLP to detect relevant concepts.  
- Implemented **4-level matching logic**:  
  - Keyword matching
    For fast and robust matching of important/recurrent keywords against their concepts
  - Fuzzy matching using `fuzzywuzzy`
    To make sure similar words/typos also get mapped
  - Semantic similarity using **Sentence-BERT** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
    To understand the semantics of the question and not just depend on keywords
  - TF-IDF fallback as a last-resort heuristic.  
    To identify key entities(Names/ORG, Place, Dates) and suggest concepts

### 2. Moved Domain Knowledge to External JSON Files  
- Extracted concept dictionaries from code into separate JSON files per subject (e.g., `ancient_history.json`, `economics.json`) for modularity and scalability.  
- These JSONs map key terms to conceptual categories (e.g., `"ghantasala" â†’ ["Port Towns", "Trade Centers"]`).  

### 3. Refactored for Maintainability and Performance  
- All embeddings and preprocessing for concepts are computed once in `main()

### 4. Manual LLM simulation
LLM - ChatGPT
Prompt - Given the question: "Question_Here", identify the historical concept(s) this question is based on.
